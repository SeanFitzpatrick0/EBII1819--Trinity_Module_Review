Effective mathematics teaching depends on many variables. These include
teachers' knowledge of mathematics and pedagogy, and of the curriculum and
how students learn the topics it contains; they also include teachers' beliefs about
and attitudes to mathematics and their philosophies of mathematics education.
Mathematics majors undertaking the module should bring good knowledge of
their subject from their primary degrees, so the focus is chiefly on the other
variables. The knowledge variables can be addressed through standard lectures,
demonstrations, discussions and reading; for the affective variables, experiential
approaches such as workshops and reflective exercises, together with discussion,
are important.

· survive during their first few months in the classroom;
